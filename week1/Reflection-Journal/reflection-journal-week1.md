# Week 1: September 4, 2023
Name: Vladislav Zakatov

# What Have You Learned This Week?

This week, my primary focus has been on refreshing my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. Understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for success in this course. However, I've also delved into several new topics, expanding my skill set. These include Node.js Fundamentals, NPM (Node Package Manager), and Visual Studio Code (VS Code), all of which were entirely new experiences for me. Additionally, I've ventured into the world of React, a new frontier on the frontend side.

# What Were the Most Challenging Topics?

To be honest, every topic presented this week came with its own set of challenges. The pace of the lectures made it difficult to keep up in real-time. Often, as soon as a new concept was introduced and demonstrated, I felt the urge to try it out on my own computer immediately. Unfortunately, I didn't have the luxury of waiting for the recorded lecture to be available on the portal for later review.

# Describe Your Group's Dynamics

Our group dynamics have been quite positive. We're fortunate to already know each other from the previous academic year, which has facilitated collaboration. Everyone is willing to assist when needed, fostering a supportive learning environment. Despite our familiarity, we all agree that the course material and lecture pace have been challenging.

# Workload: How Many Hours Per Week?

For weeks 1 and 2, I haven't precisely counted the number of hours I've dedicated to coursework. Starting from week 3, I plan to track my study hours more meticulously.

# Any Suggestions?

One suggestion that applies to both weeks 1 and 2 is related to the pace of the course. It feels like the material could be better absorbed if we had more frequent lectures, perhaps four days a week instead of two. This adjustment might allow for a slower and more in-depth exploration of the content.
