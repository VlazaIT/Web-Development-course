## Part 1. Peer Assessment

| Group Member's Name | Rate (1-5) | Justification |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Himanshu Hooda      | 5          | Himanshu was proactive this week, particularly considering his health issues. He played a vital role in the backend development of the project's sprint 2. He was notably active during our Tuesday session activities. |
| Bijay Karki         | n.d.       | Bijay had personal issues affecting his participation this week. Having worked with him before, I'm confident he'll contribute significantly in the upcoming stages. |
| Siddarth Singotam   | n.d.       | Siddarth was engrossed in the innovation competition organized by Metropolia. He couldn't contribute much during the sprint 2 phase but is expected to play a significant role in the future. |
| Vladislav Zakatov   | 5          | I maintained a high level of activity throughout the week, both during labs and project work. I developed the frontend and successfully integrated it with the backend. |

**General Impression**: The primary highlight was understanding the frontend and backend integration. Given the tutorial and the demo, the whole group didn't need to invest equally in sprint 2, and Himanshu and I were able to handle the workload effectively.

## Part 2. Reflection

### Challenges Faced:
While I generally found the week to be productive, I faced some challenges, particularly with some React topics. The classroom approach to collaborative lab work sometimes left me behind, especially when I encountered coding issues. Time management remains an area I'm working on to ensure I don't miss valuable content.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
This week, I felt a stronger grasp on both backend and frontend functionalities. The classroom activities were structured well and offered a clearer understanding. Collaborative lab sessions were particularly enlightening.

### Key Learning:
My primary takeaways include integrating MongoDB with a user API, mastering CRUD operations, and understanding React forms, hooks, and custom components based on user input.

### Online Resources:
I found a range of resources helpful this week, all of them were provided by you, Sami, like videos on CORS errors and the importance of environment files. I also delved into the integration of Node.js with MongoDB through Atlas and brushed up on React's useEffect Hook.

### Coping Strategies:
- **Academic Progress**: I've been consistent with assignments, ensuring that I complete each task thoroughly, despite not diving into optional ones.
- **Soft Skills Development**: This week was more independent in terms of collaboration. However, my interactions with Himanshu were crucial in resolving challenges.
- **Project Management**: The Agile principles remained foundational to our approach, as detailed in the peer assessment.

### Final Thoughts:
The week was a combination of triumphs and challenges. I'm pleased with my progress in both the Web Development and Project Courses. Every obstacle further solidified my learning, and I'm keen on expanding my expertise.

### Summary:

During Week 4, I experienced a blend of accomplishments and hurdles. While I grappled with React topics and struggled to keep up during collaborative sessions, I made significant strides in understanding backend and frontend interactions. I was actively involved in both lab activities and project work, ensuring a successful integration of frontend and backend. Despite the time constraints I faced, I managed to maintain consistent academic progress. I also found a balance between working independently and collaborating with others, especially in my interactions with Himanshu. This week served as a valuable opportunity for learning and growth, setting a positive tone for my future endeavors.
