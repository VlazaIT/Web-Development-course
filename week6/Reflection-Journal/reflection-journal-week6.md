# Reflection Journal for Week 6

**Student Name:** Vladislav Zakatov  
**Week:** 6

## Pair Programming

Pair programming with Bijay Karki was a unique experience for me, given I'd never done it before:

- Our initial efforts were largely spent on environment setup.
- We continuously toggled between driver and navigator roles, especially prominent on the first day.
- I spearheaded the early coding stages to set a foundational codebase, completing my contributions by Wednesday. Bijay then took the reins.
- Due to personal commitments, Bijay couldn't allocate enough time, leaving our backend—particularly the login function—incomplete. My efforts had yielded a functional registration system. Our code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/VlazaIT/pair-programming).

## Peer Assessment

This week, the typical group work was substituted with pair programming, so there isn't a peer group to assess.

## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:

The week was slightly off pace due to one lecture being cancelled because of the instructor's health. Main challenges revolved around pair programming and its associated dynamics. Time management continues to be a recurring concern.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

Constructing a comprehensive backend was challenging. While we didn't achieve a full-fledged system, the process augmented my understanding of coding logic and collaborative problem-solving.

### Key Learning:

The week's lectures offered a comprehensive understanding of password management techniques, focusing on the importance of enhanced security through salting, the nuances of password hashing, the threats posed by Rainbow Table Attacks, the practical use of bcrypt for hashing, and the mechanics and applications of JWT in JavaScript.

## Online Resources:

My primary reference was the course material. External resources were sparingly used this week.

## Coping Strategies and Academic Progress:

Regarding assignments, I delved into the intricacies of password hashing in Node.js with bcrypt and explored how to manage JWTs using the jsonwebtoken package in Node, highlighting the importance of leveraging node packages for robust user authorization flows.

## Soft Skills Development:

Communication was crucial this week, especially during pair programming. Understanding, accommodating, and navigating around Bijay's unforeseen commitments tested and honed my collaborative skills.

## Project Management:

This week's emphasis on pair programming underlined the importance of agile methodologies. Although it wasn't a project week, the principles of adaptability, continuous feedback, and iterative progress were highlighted in our collaborative coding sessions.

## Final Thoughts:

Despite the setbacks, this week was a valuable learning curve. Pair programming, while challenging, showcased the importance of effective communication and mutual respect in coding collaborations.

## Next Steps:

For the upcoming week, I plan to:
- Dive deeper into JWT and its applications.
- Work on improving time management.
- Engage in self-study sessions to further solidify this week's learning.
