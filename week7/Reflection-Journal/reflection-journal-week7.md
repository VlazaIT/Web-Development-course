# Reflection Journal for Week 7

**Student Name:** Vladislav Zakatov
**Week:** 7

## Self Assessment

- **Week 5**: Looking back at Week 5, I recall diving deep into the importance of security, particularly regarding passwords. I wrestled with understanding the intricacies of password hashing, its significance, and the mechanisms behind preventing unauthorized access, especially via brute-force attacks.

- **Week 6**: Last week, the notable experience was my first encounter with pair programming. Bijay and I had our fair share of challenges, especially in setting up the correct coding flow and dealing with incomplete backend parts due to unforeseen personal circumstances. Yet, we managed to achieve a functional registration process, providing a sound foundation for our ongoing efforts.

- **Week 7**: This week, while I was deeply involved in pair-programming sessions, my main learning stemmed from both Backend & Frontend topics. In Frontend, understanding the benefits of custom hooks over traditional functions and the effective reuse of logic across components was enlightening. On the Backend side, mastering Environment Variables in Node.js and the art of BDD Testing Style proved crucial for more efficient development processes.

In assessing my progress over these three weeks, I'd rate myself 4/5. The journey saw me adopting new topics, translating theoretical knowledge into tangible project results, and actively participating in tasks that solidified my learning.

## Pair programming

During this week, two distinct pair-programming sessions stood out. My first collaboration was with Andrii Deshko. Our synergy was evident, and while Andrii primarily took the reins due to his expertise, I played a pivotal role in troubleshooting key challenges. I'd rate his contribution as stellar, deserving a full 5/5. 

The subsequent session with Bijay Karki was equally productive. We alternated seamlessly between the driver and navigator roles, culminating in the successful completion of our shared tasks. Bijay's commitment and expertise merit a score of 5/5.

## Peer assessment

This week witnessed the execution of another project sprint. While Himanshu, Bijay, and Siddarth spearheaded most of the task, I predominantly directed my efforts towards wrapping up the previous sprint, based on a mutual agreement with the team.

## Reflection

**Challenges Faced:** One persistent challenge that stood out was time management, particularly when juxtaposed against the complexity of coding tasks. Particularly, Setting Up Jest and the ensuing refactoring of tests presented a steep learning curve. 

**What Went Well and Lessons Learned:** This week's pair programming sessions emerged as the bedrock of my learning, affording practical insights into class concepts. The iterative process of coding, testing, and refining reinforced my grasp on the topics discussed.

**Key Learning:** This week bestowed upon me a nuanced understanding of custom hooks in Frontend development, the subtleties of localStorage and sessionStorage, and the essence of BDD Testing Style in Backend development.

**Online Resources:** My primary resource remained the comprehensive material dispensed by our teacher.

**Coping Strategies & Academic Progress:** This week's academic progression was marked by two intensive pair-programming sessions and three activities that deepened my comprehension of Environment Variables, BDD Testing Style, custom hooks, and the intricacies of localStorage.

**Soft Skills Development:** My soft skills, primarily communication and collaboration, played an instrumental role this week. Engaging effectively in pair-programming sessions, clarifying doubts, and contributing constructively to discussions enhanced my progress.

**Project Management:** While this week didn't see me actively engaged in project management, the ongoing projects still demanded attention to detail and effective collaboration.

**Final Thoughts:** As I reflect upon the week, a sense of gratification envelopes me. Both the Web and Project Courses have been challenging yet immensely rewarding, presenting a spectrum of opportunities to evolve.

**Next Steps:** As we approach the course's culmination next week, my primary focus will be revising the extensive knowledge acquired, preparing assiduously for the impending exam, and ensuring our project codes are in pristine condition for the final presentation.
