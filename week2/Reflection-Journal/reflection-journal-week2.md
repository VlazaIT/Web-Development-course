# Week 2: September 4, 2023
Name: Vladislav Zakatov

# What Have You Learned This Week?

In week 2, I continued to encounter mostly new concepts, further broadening my knowledge. I delved into the basics of Express, although I admit I'm still in the process of grasping its full importance and potential. My JavaScript skills received a valuable refresher, and I also gained confidence in using terminal commands and Visual Studio Code. On the frontend side, React still presents a significant challenge for me. I believe I may need to start with even more fundamental aspects of React and progress at a slower pace to ensure a solid understanding.

# What Were the Most Challenging Topics?

This week was particularly challenging due to unexpected illness that struck in the middle of it. Coping with illness while trying to engage in lectures made it difficult to absorb and apply new knowledge effectively. Despite watching the required videos before the lectures, some of the more complex explanations from bloggers proved challenging to follow. I must admit feeling a sense of frustration and slight overwhelm after two weeks, as the course content continues to increase in complexity, and I struggle to keep up with the pace of learning.

# Describe Your Group's Dynamics

Despite the personal challenges I faced this week, our group dynamics remain positive. We made progress in our project work, including selecting our project idea, defining user stories, and creating a simple financial tracker concept in Figma. I continue to have a harmonious working relationship with my group teammates, which is a source of encouragement.

# Workload: How Many Hours Per Week?

For weeks 1 and 2, I haven't precisely counted the number of hours I've dedicated to coursework. Starting from week 3, I plan to track my study hours more meticulously.

# Any Suggestions?

One suggestion that applies to both weeks 1 and 2 is related to the pace of the course. It feels like the material could be better absorbed if we had more frequent lectures, perhaps four days a week instead of two. This adjustment might allow for a slower and more in-depth exploration of the content.
