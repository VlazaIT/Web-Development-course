**Student Name:** Vladislav Zakatov 
**Week 3:** 04.09.23 - 10.09.23


## Peer Assessment

**Group Performance**: Overall, I'd rate our group's performance at 4/5 for this week. Our team dynamics are evolving, and I'm optimistic about where we're headed.

| Group Member's Name | Rate (1-5) | Justification |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| Bijay Karki         | 5          | Bijay has exhibited exemplary leadership qualities this week. His readiness to assist and maintain awareness on all fronts makes him a pillar in our group. He's deeply vested in each topic, making him invaluable to our efforts. |
| Himanshu Hooda      | 5          | Himanshu arguably grasps the course material the best amongst us. His ability to elucidate complex topics and lend a helping hand cements his position as a significant asset to the group. |
| Siddarth Singotam   | 4          | Siddarth's passion is evident. While he might need to catch up on some study material, his enthusiasm and readiness to assist can't be overlooked. |
| [Your Name]         | 3          | Speaking for myself, I'd rate my performance at 3/5. Time constraints and a comparative lack of knowledge hindered my active participation. However, I'm hopeful that as the course progresses, my contribution will amplify. |

**Group Cohesiveness**: Our group has fostered an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. Each member is candid about their strengths and weaknesses, which has significantly benefited our collaborative efforts. I believe a true assessment of our group's capabilities will manifest once we undertake more intensive project tasks.

## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:
This week was a medley of challenges. I grappled with understanding some intricate coding concepts. Moreover, managing time efficiently to juggle between lectures, labs, and personal commitments was strenuous. Navigating group dynamics also posed occasional hurdles, but collaborative efforts eased the way.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
This week, independent coding took precedence. The experience enhanced my understanding of code intricacies. Mastering git and seeking help from teammates, online resources, and CHATGPT was a significant triumph. A pivotal lesson learned was the need to allocate dedicated post-lecture time for labs, ensuring a deep dive into the material.

### Key Learning:
The journey into Frontend and Backend deepened my understanding of Express.js, particularly with routers and controllers. On the frontend, concepts like array destructuring, React events, and state management using the useState Hook provided insights into dynamic web app creation. Additionally, project lectures enriched knowledge about MVC patterns, the Event Loop, and the importance of refactoring.

### Coping Strategies:
**Academic Progress**: This week, though devoid of grades, marked significant academic advancement. The shift to independent coding and enhanced git understanding stands testimony to this.

**Soft Skills Development**: My independent coding efforts boosted problem-solving and critical thinking. Time management surfaced as an area needing attention, while collaborative efforts polished interpersonal skills.

**Project Management**: This week didn't witness project steps, but I foresee the impending week brimming with challenges and opportunities.

### Final Thoughts:
The week was an amalgamation of triumphs, lessons, and realizations. Every challenge is a stepping stone, and every lesson propels growth.

### Next Steps:
For the upcoming week, my intent is to channelize focus on lecture materials, ensuring a proactive approach. Eagerly awaiting the advanced coding insights as hinted by Sami, I believe it'll provide a strong foundation for our group project.
