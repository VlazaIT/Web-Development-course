# Reflection Journal for Week 3
**Student Name:** Vladislav Zakatov 

**Week 3:** 04.09.23 - 10.09.23

## Peer Assessment

**Group Performance**: I think our group did pretty well this week, getting a 4 out of 5. I believe we're getting better at working together.

| Group Member's Name | Rate (1-5) | Justification |
|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| Bijay Karki         | 5          | Bijay is a strong leader. He's always ready to help and keeps track of everything. He's really into every topic we discuss. |
| Himanshu Hooda      | 5          | Himanshu knows the course material very well. He explains tough stuff and is always there to help. |
| Siddarth Singotam   | 4          | Siddarth is super excited and helps a lot. He might need to study a bit more, but he's always trying hard. |
| Vladislav Zakatov   | 3          | For myself, I'd say I did okay, maybe a 3 out of 5. I couldn't be as active because I was busy and needed to learn more. But I hope to do better soon. |

**Group Cohesiveness**: We all get along well in our group. Everyone is honest about what they're good at and what they need to work on. I think we'll show our real strengths when we start big projects.

## Reflection

### Challenges Faced:
This week was tough. I had a hard time with some coding stuff. It was hard to find time for everything like classes, labs, and my own stuff. Sometimes working in the group was tricky, but we figured it out together. Every day was a new learning experience.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
I did a lot of coding by myself this week. This helped me understand coding better. I got better at using git, asked my teammates and online for help, and even talked to CHATGPT. I learned that I should set aside time after class to go over labs. This will help me understand things deeper.

### Key Learning:
I learned more about how to build the Frontend and Backend of websites. I understood how Express.js works, especially the parts about routers and controllers. I also learned how to use React for building parts of websites. The classes taught me about the MVC pattern, how events work in coding, and why it's important to organize code well. Every day had something new to offer.

### Coping Strategies:
**Academic Progress**: Even though I didn't get grades this week, I learned a lot. I did a lot of coding on my own and got better at using git. Each challenge pushed me to do better.

**Soft Skills Development**: Working on my own helped me think and solve problems. I need to get better at managing my time. Working with others also helped me learn to talk and listen better. Every discussion brought new insights.

**Project Management**: We didn't start the project this week, but I think next week will be busy with lots of new things to do. I'm ready for whatever comes next.

### Final Thoughts:
This week had ups and downs. But every hard part was a chance to learn. I'm growing and getting better every day.

### Next Steps:
Next week, I want to focus on the class materials and stay ahead. I'm waiting for Sami's next coding tips. I think this will help us with our group project. I'm excited for what's coming up.
